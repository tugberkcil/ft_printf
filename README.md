## 🗣️ About

> _The project at hand is rather simple. You'll have to redo printf. Hopefully you won't have to worry about being 
accused of cheating if you utilize it again in a future project. The key thing you'll learn is how to employ variadic arguments._

For detailed information, refer to the [**subject of this project**](https://github.com/appinha/42cursus/tree/master/_PDFs).

	🚀 TLDR: The goal of this project is to provide a library with a condensed version of the printf function.
